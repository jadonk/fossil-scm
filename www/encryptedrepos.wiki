<title>How To Use Encrypted Repositories</title>
<h2>Introduction</h2><blockquote>
Fossil can be compiled so that it works with encrypted repositories using
the [https://www.sqlite.org/see/doc/trunk/www/readme.wiki|SQLite Encryption Extension].
This technical note explains the process.
</blockquote>
<h2>Building An Encryption-Enabled Fossil</h2><blockquote>
The SQLite Encryption Extension (SEE) is proprietary software and requires 
[http://www.hwaci.com/cgi-bin/see-step1|purchasing a license].
<p>
Assuming you have an SEE license, the first step of compiling Fossil to
use SEE is to create an SEE-enabled version of the SQLite database source code.
This alternative SQLite database source file should be called "sqlite3-see.c"
and should be placed in the src/ subfolder of the Fossil sources, right beside
the public-domain "sqlite3.c" source file.  Also make a copy of the SEE-enabled
"shell.c" file, renamed as "shell-see.c", and place it in the src/ subfolder
beside the original "shell.c".
<p>
Add the --with-see command-line option to the configuration script to enable
the use of SEE on unix-like systems.
<blockquote><pre>
./configure --with-see; make
</pre></blockquote>
<p>To build for Windows using MSVC, add
the "USE_SEE=1" argument to the "nmake" command line.
<blockquote><pre>
nmake -f makefile.msc USE_SEE=1
</pre></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h2>Using Encrypted Repositories</h2><blockquote>
Any Fossil repositories whose filename ends with ".efossil" is taken to be
an encrypted repository.  Fossil will prompt for the encryption password and
attempt to open the repository database using that password.
<p>
Every invocation of fossil on an encrypted repository requires retyping the
encryption password.
To avoid excess password typing, consider using the "fossil shell"
command which prompts for the password just once, then reuses it for each
subsequent Fossil command entered at the prompt.
<p>
On Windows, the "fossil server", "fossil ui", and "fossil shell" commands do not
(currently) work on an encrypted repository.
